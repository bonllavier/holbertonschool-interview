# Heap Insert

## Binary Tree
A binary tree is a special type of tree in which every node or vertex has either no child node or one child node or two child nodes. A binary tree is an important class of a tree data structure in which a node can have at most two children.

Child node in a binary tree on the left is termed as 'left child node' and node in the right is termed as the 'right child node.'

In the figure mentioned below, the root node 8 has two children 3 and 10; then this two child node again acts as a parent node for 1 and 6 for left parent node 3 and 14 for right parent node 10. Similarly, 6 and 14 has a child node.

## 0. New node
Write a function that creates a binary tree node:

## 1. Heap - Insert 
Write a function that inserts a value into a Max Binary Heap:
